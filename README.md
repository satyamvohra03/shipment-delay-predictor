# Shipment Delay Predictor 🚚

A machine learning project to predict whether a shipment will be delayed based on historical logistics data.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Git + GitHub

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Build a binary classifier to predict shipment delays using origin, destination, SLA, date patterns, and distance-based features.

## 📊 Features (in dataset)
- Origin & destination hubs
- SLA threshold (in hours)
- Distance
- Pickup date
- Delivery date
- Delay flag (target variable)

## 📈 Target
`delayed`: 0 = On-time, 1 = Delayed

## 🚀 Goal
Use this project to demonstrate understanding of:
- EDA and feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation
- Practical ML in logistics/supply chain domain
